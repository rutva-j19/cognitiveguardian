# 🧠 Cognitive Guardian: Hospital-Induced Delirium Prevention
A specialized cognitive assessment system (CAS) designed to detect and prevent hospital-induced delirium (HID) in ICU patients. This ecosystem integrates Arduino telemetry with a gamified interface to monitor cognitive health, validated by medical professionals to reduce manual screening time by ~40%.

# 🚀 Features
Adaptive Cognitive Testing: Gamified assessments tailored across 4 distinct age demographics, ensuring accessibility and accurate baselining for elderly patients.

Secure Authentication: Robust login verification system to ensure patient data privacy and secure access for authorized medical personnel.

CSV Telemetry Archival: Built a scalable backend that archives patient performance data in CSV format, enabling easy data export for long-term trend analysis.

Multi-User Management: Supports 25+ distinct user profiles, allowing clinicians to track individual patient progress and switch contexts seamlessly.

Clinical Workflow Optimization: Streamlines the assessment process, significantly reducing the burden on nursing staff while improving response times for potential delirium symptoms.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

Backend/Database: Supabase (with CSV Data Export)

Hardware Logic: C++ (Arduino/ESP32)

AI Integration: Lovable AI (Interface Prototyping & Logic)

Deployment: Netlify 

# 📋 Architecture
The project is architected to prioritize data integrity and clinical utility:

Input: Patients engage with physical hardware buttons in response to LED sequences, minimizing screen fatigue.

Processing: The system synthesizes sensor inputs to calculate reaction latency and accuracy.

Persistence: Patient telemetry is securely logged and formatted into CSV files within the Supabase backend for easy retrieval.

Visualization: Individualized dashboards render the CSV data into actionable performance trends for doctors.
